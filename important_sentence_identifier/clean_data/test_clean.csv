At last his councillors said, 'The King must marry again, so that we may have a queen.' So messengers were sent far and wide to seek for a bride equal to the late Queen in beauty. But there was no one in the wide world, and if there had been she could not have had such golden hair. Then the messengers came home again, not having been able to find a queen.",The king felt when his wife died by devastated.

13,510,"Besides these, I want a cloak made of a thousand different kinds of skin; every animal in your kingdom must give a bit of his skin to it.' But she thought to herself, 'This will be quite impossible, and I shall not have to marry someone I do not care for.' The King, however, was not to be turned from his purpose, and he commanded the most skilled maidens in his kingdom to weave the three dresses, one as golden as the sun, and one as silver as the moon, and one as shining as the stars; and he gave orders to all his huntsmen to catch one of every kind of beast in the kingdom, and to get a bit of its skin to make the cloak of a thousand pieces of fur. At last, when all was ready, the King commanded the cloak to be brought to him, and he spread it out before the Princess, and said, 'Tomorrow shall be your wedding-day.' When the Princess saw that there was no more hope of changing her father's resolution, she determined to flee away. In the night, when everyone else was sleeping, she got up and took three things from her treasures, a gold ring, a little gold spinning-wheel, and a gold reel; she put the sun, moon, and star dresses in a nut-shell, drew on the cloak of many skins, and made her face and hands black with soot. Then she commended herself to God, and went out and travelled the whole night till she came to a large forest. And as she was very much tired she sat down inside a hollow tree and fell asleep.",The princess will feel when the king fulfills her request by surprised.
14,510,"The sun rose and she still slept on and on, although it was nearly noon. Now, it happened that the king to whom this wood belonged was hunting in it. When his dogs came to the tree, they sniffed, and ran round and round it, barking. The King said to the huntsmen, 'See what sort of a wild beast is in there.' The huntsmen went in, and then came back and said, 'In the hollow tree there lies a wonderful animal that we don't know, and we have never seen one like it; its skin is made of a thousand pieces of fur; but it is lying down asleep.' The King said, 'See if you can catch it alive, and then fasten it to the cart, and we will take it with us.' When the huntsmen seized the maiden, she awoke and was frightened, and cried out to them, 'I am a poor child, forsaken by father and mother; take pity on me, and let me go with you.' Then they said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can work in the kitchen; come with us and sweep the ashes together.' So they put her in the cart and they went back to the palace. There they showed her a tiny room under the stairs, where no daylight came, and said to her, 'Many-furred Creature, you can live and sleep here.' Then she was sent into the kitchen, where she carried wood and water, poked the fire, washed vegetables, plucked fowls, swept up the ashes, and did all the dirty work.  So the Many-furred Creature lived for a long time in great poverty. Ah, beautiful King's daughter, what is going to befall you now?",The dogs barked at the tree because they could smell something in the tree.

15,510,"She had run to her little room and had quickly taken off her dress, made  her face and hands black, put on the fur cloak, and was once more the  Many-furred Creature. When she came into the kitchen and was setting  about her work of sweeping the ashes together, the cook said to her,  'Let that wait till to-morrow, and just cook the King's soup for me; I  want to have a little peep at the company upstairs; but be sure that you  do not let a hair fall into it, otherwise you will get nothing to eat in  future!' So the cook went away, and the Many-furred Creature cooked the  soup for the King. She made a bread-soup as well as she possibly could,  and when it was done, she fetched her gold ring from her little room,  and laid it in the tureen in which the soup was to be served up.",The cook wanted to peep at the company upstairs because he heard about a fair maiden there.

16,510,"When the Many-furred Creature came, the King asked her who she  was. 'I am a poor child without father or mother.' Then he asked her,  'What do you do in my palace?' 'I am of no use except to have boots  thrown at my head.' 'How did you get the ring which was in the soup?' he  asked. 'I know nothing at all about the ring,' she answered. So the King  could find out nothing, and was obliged to send her away.    After a time there was another feast, and the Many-furred Creature  begged the cook as at the last one to let her go and look on. He  answered, 'Yes, but come back again in half-an-hour and cook the King  the bread-soup that he likes so much.' So she ran away to her little  room, washed herself quickly, took out of the nut the dress as silver  as the moon and put it on. Then she went upstairs looking just like a  King's daughter, and the King came towards her, delighted to see her  again, and as the dance had just begun, they danced together.",The Many - furred Creature said she did not know where the ring came from she did not want the king to know she was his daughter.
17,510,"But when the dance was ended, she disappeared again so quickly that the King could not see which way she went. She ran to her little room and changed herself once more into the Many-furred Creature, and went into the kitchen to cook the bread-soup. When the cook was upstairs, she fetched the golden spinning-wheel and put it in the dish so that the soup was poured over it. It was brought to the King, who ate it, and liked it as much as the last time. He had the cook sent to him, and again he had to confess that the Many-furred Creature had cooked the soup. Then the Many-furred Creature came before the King, but she said again that she was of no use except to have boots thrown at her head, and that she knew nothing at all of the golden spinning-wheel.  When the King had a feast for the third time, things did not turn out quite the same as at the other two. The cook said, 'You must be a witch, Many-furred Creature, for you always put something in the soup, so that it is much better and tastes nicer to the King than any that I cook.' But because she begged hard, he let her go up for the usual time. Now she put on the dress as shining as the stars, and stepped into the hall in it.",The king had the cook sent to him again because he found a golden spinning - wheel in the soup.
18,510,"The King danced again with the beautiful maiden, and thought she had never looked so beautiful. And while he was dancing, he put a gold ring on her finger without her seeing it, and he commanded that the dance should last longer than usual. When it was finished he wanted to keep her hands in his, but she broke from him, and sprang so quickly away among the people that she vanished from his sight. She ran as fast as she could to her little room under the stairs, but because she had stayed too long beyond the half-hour, she could not stop to take off the beautiful dress, but only threw the fur cloak over it, and in her haste she did not make herself quite black with the soot, one finger remaining white.",The king wanted to keep the maiden's hand in his because he loved her.
1,512,"Once upon a time there lived near a forest a man and his wife and two girls; one girl was the daughter of the man, and the other the daughter of his wife; and the man's daughter was good and beautiful, but the woman's daughter was cross and ugly.

2,512,"One day the man called to his daughter and bade her come with him into the forest to cut wood. They worked hard all day, but in spite of the chopping they were very cold, for it rained heavily, and when they returned home, they were wet through. Then, to his vexation, the man found that he had left his axe behind him, and he knew that if it lay all night in the mud it would become rusty and useless. So he said to his wife:  'I have dropped my axe in the forest, bid your daughter go and fetch it, for mine has worked hard all day and is both wet and weary.'",The man realized he left his axe behind when he got home.

3,512,"But the wife answered:  'If your daughter is wet already, it is all the more reason that she should go and get the axe. Besides, she is a great strong girl, and a little rain will not hurt her, while my daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.'  By long experience the man knew there was no good saying any more, and with a sigh he told the poor girl she must return to the forest for the axe.",The wife did not want her daughter to fetch the axe because her daughter would be sure to catch a bad cold.
4,512,"The walk took some time, for it was very dark, and her shoes often stuck in the mud, but she was brave as well as beautiful and never thought of turning back merely because the path was both difficult and unpleasant. At last, with her dress torn by brambles that she could not see, and her fact scratched by the twigs on the trees, she reached the spot where she and her father had been cutting in the morning, and found the axe in the place he had left it. To her surprise, three little doves were sitting on the handle, all of them looking very sad.",The man's daughter felt about seeing the three little doves by surprised.
5,512,"You poor little things,' said the girl, stroking them. 'Why do you sit there and get wet? Go and fly home to your nest, it will be much warmer than this; but first eat this bread, which I saved from my dinner, and perhaps you will feel happier. It is my father's axe you are sitting on, and I must take it back as fast as I can, or I shall get a terrible scolding from my stepmother.' She then crumbled the bread on the ground, and was pleased to see the doves flutter quite cheerfully towards it.  'Good-bye,' she said, picking up the axe, and went her way homewards.  By the time they had finished all the crumbs the doves felt must better, and were able to fly back to their nest in the top of a tree.",The man's daughter gave bread the little doves.
6,512,"That is a good girl,' said one; 'I really was too weak to stretch out a wing before she came. I should like to do something to show how grateful I am.'  'Well, let us give her a wreath of flowers that will never fade as long as she wears it,' cried another.  'And let the tiniest singing birds in the world sit amongst the flowers,' rejoined the third.  'Yes, that will do beautifully,' said the first. And when the girl stepped into her cottage a wreath of rosebuds was on her head, and a crowd of little birds were singing unseen.  The father, who was sitting by the fire, thought that, in spite of her muddy clothes, he had never seen his daughter looking so lovely; but the stepmother and the other girl grew wild with envy.",The little birds gave a wreath of flowers the man's daughter to show their gratitude.

7,512,"How absurd to walk about on such a pouring night, dressed up like that,' she remarked crossly, and roughly pulled off the wreath as she spoke, to place it on her own daughter. As she did so the roses became withered and brown, and the birds flew out of the window.  'See what a trumpery thing it is!' cried the stepmother; 'and now take your supper and go to bed, for it is near upon midnight.'  But though she pretended to despise the wreath, she longed none the less for her daughter to have one like it.  Now it happened that the next evening the father, who had been alone in the forest, came back a second time without his axe. The stepmother's heart was glad when she saw this, and she said quite mildly:  'Why, you have forgotten your axe again, you careless man! But now your daughter shall stay at home, and mine shall go and bring it back'; and throwing a cloak over the girl's shoulders, she bade her hasten to the forest.",Withered and browned to the roses when the wife put the wreath on her daughter's head.
8,512,"With a very ill grace the damsel set forth, grumbling to herself as she went; for though she wished for the wreath, she did not at all want the trouble of getting it.  By the time she reached the spot where her stepfather had been cutting the wood the girl was in a very bad temper indeed, and when she caught sight of the axe, there were the three little doves, with drooping heads and soiled, bedraggled feathers, sitting on the handle.  'You dirty creatures,' cried she, 'get away at once, or I will throw stones at you! And the doves spread their wings in a fright and flew up to the very top of a tree, their bodies shaking with anger.  'What shall we do to revenge ourselves on her?' asked the smallest of the doves, 'we were never treated like that before.'  'Never,' said the biggest dove. 'We must find some way of paying her back in her own coin!'  'I know,' answered the middle dove; 'she shall never be able to say anything but ""dirty creatures"" to the end of her life.'  'Oh, how clever of you! That will do beautifully,' exclaimed the other two. And they flapped their wings and clucked so loud with delight, and made such a noise, that they woke up all the birds in the trees close by.",The wife's daughter felt about getting the axe by annoyed.
9,512,"You are at the bottom of this, I know,' she cried; and as the father was out of the way she took a stick and beat the girl till she screamed with pain and went to bed sobbing.  If the poor girl's life had been miserable before, it was ten times worse now, for the moment her father's back was turned the others teased and tormented her from morning till night; and their fury was increased by the sight of her wreath, which the doves had placed again on her head.",The sight of the girl's wreath increased the wife's and wife's daughter's fury.
10,512,"Things went on like this for some weeks, when, one day, as the king's son was riding through the forest, he heard some strange birds singing more sweetly than birds had ever sung before. He tied his horse to a tree, and followed where the sound led him, and, to his surprise, he saw before him a beautiful girl chopping wood, with a wreath of pink rose-buds, out of which the singing came. Standing in the shelter of a tree, he watched her a long while, and then, hat in hand, he went up and spoke to her.  'Fair maiden, who are you, and who gave you that wreath of singing roses?' asked he, for the birds were so tiny that till you looked closely you never saw them.",The prince tied his horse to a tree and followed where the sound led him when he heard some strange birds singing.
11,512,"I live in a hut on the edge of the forest,' she answered, blushing, for she had never spoken to a prince before. 'As to the wreath, I know not how it came there, unless it may be the gift of some doves whom I fed when they were starving! The prince was delighted with this answer, which showed the goodness of the girl's heart, and besides he had fallen in love with her beauty, and would not be content till she promised to return with him to the palace, and become his bride. The old king was naturally disappointed at his son's choice of a wife, as he wished him to marry a neighbouring princess; but as from his birth the prince had always done exactly as he like, nothing was said and a splendid wedding feast was got ready.",The old king felt disapointed at his son's choice of a wife because he wished him to marry a neighboring princess.
12,512,"Her plan was this. In the town where she had lived before she was married there was an old witch, who had more skill in magic that any other witch she knew. To this witch she would go and beg her to make her a mask with the face of her stepdaughter, and when she had the mask the rest would be easy. She told her daughter what she meant to do, and although the daughter could only say 'dirty creatures,' in answer, she nodded and smiled and looked well pleased.",The wife planned to ask for an old witch help.
13,512,"In a few days she heard that a great hunt was planned, and the prince would leave the palace very early in the morning, so that his wife would be alone all day. This was a chance not to be missed, and taking her daughter with her she went up to the palace, where she had never been before. The princess was too happy in her new home to remember all that she had suffered in the old one, and she welcomed them both gladly, and gave them quantities of beautiful things to take back with them. At last she took them down to the shore to see a pleasure boat which her husband had had made for her; and here, the woman seizing her opportunity, stole softly behind the girl and pushed her off the rock on which she was standing, into the deep water, where she instantly sank to the bottom. Then she fastened the mask on her daughter, flung over her shoulders a velvet cloak, which the princess had let fall, and finally arranged a lace veil over her head.",The princess felt in her new home by happy.

14,512,"The next morning he went to the false bride's room, but her ladies told him she would neither speak nor get up, though she ate everything they set before her. The prince was sorely perplexed as to what could be the matter with her, for naturally he could not guess that she was expecting her mother to return every moment, and to remove the spell the doves had laid upon her, and meanwhile was afraid to speak lest she should betray herself. At length he made up his mind to summon all the court physicians; he did not tell her what he was going to do, lest it should make her worse, but he went himself and begged the four learned leeches attached to the king's person to follow him to the princess's apartments. Unfortunately, as they entered, the princess was so enraged at the sight of them that she forgot all about the doves, and shrieked out: 'Dirty creatures! dirty creatures!' which so offended the physicians that they left the room at once, and nothing that the prince could say would prevail on them to remain. He then tried to persuade his wife to send them a message that she was sorry for her rudeness, but not a word would she say.",The physicians left the room at once after the princess shrieked at them.

16,512,"It was nearly midnight before he returned to the palace, but, instead of entering, he went down to the shore and hid behind a rock. He had scarcely done so when the girl came out of the sea, and stretched out her arms towards his window. In an instant the prince had seized her hand, and though she made a frightened struggle to reach the water-for she in her turn had had a spell laid upon her-he held her fast.  'You are my own wife, and I shall never let you go,' he said. But the words were hardly out of his mouth when he found that it was a hare that he was holding by the paw. Then the hare changed into a fish, and the fish into a bird, and the bird into a slimy wriggling snake. This time the prince's hand nearly opened of itself, but with a strong effort he kept his fingers shut, and drawing his sword cut off its head, when the spell was broken, and the girl stood before him as he had seen her first, the wreath upon her head and the birds singing for joy.",The prince broke the curse on the princess by cut off the snake's head.
1,514,"Once upon a time there was a poor woman, who lived in a wretched hut far away from the village. She had but little to bite and less to burn, so she sent her little boy to the forest to gather wood. He skipped and leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he crossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ""O, you poor old stone, how white and pale you are! You must be freezing terribly!"" said the boy; took off his jacket, and laid it over the stone. And when he came back home with his wood, his mother asked him how it was that he was going around in the autumn cold in his shirt-sleeves. He told her that he had seen a jagged old stone, quite white and pale with the frost, and that he had given it his jacket. ""You fool,"" said the woman, ""do you think a stone can freeze? And even if it had chattered with frost, still, charity begins at home. Your clothes cost enough as it is, even when you don't hang them on the stones out in the field!""--and with that she drove the boy out again to fetch his jacket. When he came to the stone, the stone had turned around, and had raised itself from the ground on one side.",The poor woman lived in a wretched hut far away from the village.

He skipped and leaped, and leaped and skipped, in order to keep warm, for it was a cold, gray autumn day, and whenever he had gathered a root or a branch to add to his bundle, he had to slap his arms against his shoulders, for the cold made his hands as red as the whortleberry bushes over which he walked. When he had filled his barrow, and was wandering homeward, he crossed a field of stubble. There he saw lying a jagged white stone. ""O, you poor old stone, how white and pale you are!

As sure as there is a sun in heaven I will have some of them this night, for I have grown so thin that my very bones rattle, and my poor babies are crying for food.' And as she spoke she reached a little plot of grass, where the two roads joined, and flung herself under a tree to take a little rest, and to settle her plans. At this moment the wolf came up.",The fox flung herself to take a little rest in a tree.
4,516,"At the sight of the fox lying within his grasp his mouth began to water, but his joy was somewhat checked when he noticed how thin she was. The fox's quick ears heard the sound of his paws, though they were soft as velvet, and turning her head she said politely:  'Is that you, neighbour? What a strange place to meet in! I hope you are quite well?'  'Quite well as regards my health,' answered the wolf, whose eye glistened greedily, 'at least, as well as one can be when one is very hungry. But what is the matter with you? A fortnight ago you were as plump as heart could wish!'  'I have been ill-very ill,' replied the fox, 'and what you say is quite true. A worm is fat in comparison with me.'",The wolf's joy was somewhat checked because he noticed how thin the fox was.

5,516,"All was silent in the village, and not a light was to be seen but that of the moon, which shone bright and clear in the sky. The wolf and the fox crept softly along, when suddenly they stopped and looked at each other; a savoury smell of frying bacon reached their noses, and reached the noses of the sleeping dogs, who began to bark greedily.  'Is it safe to go on, think you?' asked the wolf in a whisper. And the fox shook her head.  'Not while the dogs are barking,' said she; 'someone might come out to see if anything was the matter.' And she signed to the wolf to curl himself up in the shadow beside her.  In about half an hour the dogs grew tired of barking, or perhaps the bacon was eaten up and there was no smell to excite them. Then the wolf and the fox jumped up, and hastened to the foot of the wall.",When the savory smell of frying bacon reached their noses the wolf and fox suddenly stopped and looked at each other and the sleeping dogs began to bark.
6,516,"Why, it is larger and richer than I thought,' cried she, turning towards the wolf, who was leaning over the wall of the well.  'Then be quick and bring it up,' commanded the wolf.  'How can I, when it weighs more than I do?' asked the fox.  'If it is so heavy bring it in two bits, of course,' said he.  'But I have no knife,' answered the fox. 'You will have to come down yourself, and we will carry it up between us.'  'And how am I to come down?' inquired the wolf.  'Oh, you are really very stupid! Get into the other bucket that is nearly over your head.'  The wolf looked up, and saw the bucket hanging there, and with some difficulty he climbed into it. As he weighed at least four times as much as the fox the bucket went down with a jerk, and the other bucket, in which the fox was seated, came to the surface.",The fox said she could not bring the bring up the cheese by herself because it weighed more than she did.
7,516,"As soon as he understood what was happening, the wolf began to speak like an angry wolf, but was a little comforted when he remembered that the cheese still remained to him.  'But where is the cheese?' he asked of the fox, who in her turn was leaning over the parapet watching his proceedings with a smile.  'The cheese?' answered the fox; 'why I am taking it home to my babies, who are too young to get food for themselves.'  'Ah, traitor!' cried the wolf, howling with rage. But the fox was not there to hear this insult, for she had gone off to a neighbouring fowl-house, where she had noticed some fat young chickens the day before.  'Perhaps I did treat him rather badly,' she said to herself. 'But it seems getting cloudy, and if there should be heavy rain the other bucket will fill and sink to the bottom, and his will go up-at least it may!'",The wolf felt after realizing the fox tricked him by enraged.
8,516,"I am dying of hunger,' answered the wolf, doggedly; 'and you know,' he added with a grin, 'that charity begins at home.'  'Quite so,' replied the fox; 'it would be unreasonable of me to object to your satisfying your appetite at my expense. But if the fox resigns herself to the sacrifice, the mother offers you one last request.'  'Then be quick and don't waste my time, for I can't wait much longer. What is it you want?'  'You must know,' said the fox, 'that in this village there is a rich man who makes in the summer enough cheeses to last him for the whole year, and keeps them in an old well, now dry, in his courtyard. By the well hang two buckets on a pole that were used, in former days, to draw up water. For many nights I have crept down to the palace, and have lowered myself in the bucket, bringing home with me enough cheese to feed the children. All I beg of you is to come with me, and, instead of hunting chickens and such things, I will make a good meal off cheese before I die.'  'But the cheeses may be all finished by now?'  'If you were only to see the quantities of them!' laughed the fox. 'And even if they were finished, there would always be ME to eat.'  'Well, I will come. Lead the way, but I warn you that if you try to escape or play any tricks you are reckoning without your host-that is to say, without my legs, which are as long as yours!'",The rich man kept his cheeses according to the fox in an old well.

He placed the jewel in the cup and returned it to them, and said, bowing deeply:  ""This is a token of my thanks!""","Mikoto received the water by both hands, raising it to the height of his forehead."
21,520,"The two ladies took the cup, and looking into it to see what he had put inside-for they did not yet know what it was-they gave a start of surprise, for there lay a beautiful gem at the bottom of the cup.  ""No ordinary mortal would give away a jewel so freely. Will you not honor us by telling us who you are?"" said the elder damsel.

23,520,"""Are you indeed the daughters of Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea? I cannot tell you how glad I am to meet you,"" said the Happy Hunter. And without waiting for them to reply he went on:  ""The other day I went fishing with my brother's hook and dropped it, how, I am sure I can't tell. As my brother prizes his fishing hook above all his other possessions, this is the greatest calamity that could have befallen me. Unless I find it again I can never hope to win my brother's forgiveness, for he is very angry at what I have done. I have searched for it many, many times, but I cannot find it, therefore I am much troubled. While I was hunting for the hook, in great distress, I met a wise old man, and he told me that the best thing I could do was to come to Ryn Gu, and to Ryn Jin, the Dragon King of the Sea, and ask him to help me. This kind old man also showed me how to come. Now you know how it is I am here and why. I want to ask Ryn Jin, if he knows where the lost hook is. Will you be so kind as to take me to your father? And do you think he will see me?"" asked the Happy Hunter anxiously.",Was the Happy Hunter happy to meet the daughters of Ryn Jin because he needed to ask Ryn Jin to help him.

I am sure he will say that good fortune has befallen him, that so great and noble a man as you, the grandson of Amaterasu, should come down to the bottom of the sea."" And then turning to her younger sister, she said:  ""Do you not think so, Tamayori?""  ""Yes, indeed,"" answered the Princess Tamayori, in her sweet voice. ""As you say, we can know no greater honor than to welcome the Mikoto to our home.""  ""Then I ask you to be so kind as to lead the way,"" said the Happy Hunter.

The Dragon King of the Sea was much surprised at the news, for it was but seldom, perhaps only once in several hundred years, that the Sea King's Palace was visited by mortals.",The Dragon King was surprised at the news because it was seldom that the Sea King's Palace was visited by mortals.
26,520,"Ryn Jin at once clapped his hands and summoned all his courtiers and the servants of the Palace, and the chief fish of the sea together, and solemnly told them that the grandson of the Sun Goddess, Amaterasu, was coming to the Palace, and that they must be very ceremonious and polite in serving the august visitor.

Condescend to remember us forever!""",Ryn Jin wore robes of ceremony.
28,520,"""Are you indeed Ryn Jin, the King of the Sea, of whom I have so often heard?"" answered the Happy Hunter, saluting his host most ceremoniously. ""I must apologize for all the trouble I am giving you by my unexpected visit."" And he bowed again, and thanked the Sea King.  ""You need not thank me,"" said Ryn Jin. ""It is I who must thank you for coming.

29,520,"There was much gladness between the Sea King and the Happy Hunter, and they sat and talked for a long time.

It was indeed the TAI who had taken the hook, but he had already suffered enough for his fault, if fault it could be called. What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention.

2,526,"At the time when the Tang dynasty reigned over the Middle Kingdom, there were master swordsmen of various kinds. Those who came first were the saints of the sword. They were able to take different shapes at will, and their swords were like strokes of lightning. Before their opponents knew they had been struck their heads had already fallen. Yet these master swordsmen were men of lofty mind, and did not lightly mingle in the quarrels of the world. The second kind of master swordsmen were the sword heroes. It was their custom to slay the unjust, and to come to the aid of the oppressed. They wore a hidden dagger at their side and carried a leather bag at their belt. By magic means they were able to turn human heads into flowing water. They could fly over roofs and walk up and down walls, and they came and went and left no trace.

9,528,"""I'm in luck!"" thought the jelly fish. ""Now I must flatter the creature and try to entice him to come back with me to the Palace, and my part will be done!""  So the jelly fish slowly walked towards the pine-tree. In those ancient days the jelly fish had four legs and a hard shell like a tortoise. When he got to the pine-tree he raised his voice and said:  ""How do you do, Mr. Monkey? Isn't it a lovely day?""  ""A very fine day,"" answered the monkey from the tree. ""I have never seen you in this part of the world before. Where have you come from and what is your name?""  ""My name is kurage or jelly fish. I am one of the servants of the Dragon King.

""By the bye,"" said the jelly fish, ""have you ever seen the Palace of the Dragon King of the Sea where I live?""  ""I have often heard of it, but I have never seen it!"" answered the monkey.  ""Then you ought most surely to come. It is a great pity for you to go through life without seeing it. The beauty of the Palace is beyond all description-it is certainly to my mind the most lovely place in the world,"" said the jelly fish.",The monkey asked the jelly fish for his name because he had never seen him in this part of the world before.
10,528,"""Is it so beautiful as all that?"" asked the monkey in astonishment.  Then the jelly fish saw his chance, and went on describing to the best of his ability the beauty and grandeur of the Sea King's Palace, and the wonders of the garden with its curious trees of white, pink and red coral, and the still more curious fruits like great jewels hanging on the branches. The monkey grew more and more interested, and as he listened he came down the tree step by step so as not to lose a word of the wonderful story.",The monkey felt when he heard about the Palace by astonished.
11,528,"""I have got him at last!"" thought the jelly fish, but aloud he said:  ""Mr. Monkey. I must now go back. As you have never seen the Palace of the Dragon King, won't you avail yourself of this splendid opportunity by coming with me? I shall then be able to act as guide and show you all the sights of the sea, which will be even more wonderful to you-a land-lubber.""  ""I should love to go,"" said the monkey, ""but how am I to cross the water! I can't swim, as you surely know!""  ""There is no difficulty about that. I can carry you on my back.""  ""That will be troubling you too much,"" said the monkey.  ""I can do it quite easily. I am stronger than I look, so you needn't hesitate,"" said the jelly fish, and taking the monkey on his back he stepped into the sea.  ""Keep very still, Mr. monkey,"" said the jelly fish. ""You mustn't fall into the sea; I am responsible for your safe arrival at the King's Palace.""  ""Please don't go so fast, or I am sure I shall fall off,"" said the monkey.",The jelly fish brought the monkey back by carried him on his back.
12,528,"Thus they went along, the jelly fish skimming through the waves with the monkey sitting on his back. When they were about half-way, the jelly fish, who knew very little of anatomy, began to wonder if the monkey had his liver with him or not!  ""Mr. Monkey, tell me, have you such a thing as a liver with you?""  The monkey was very much surprised at this queer question, and asked what the jelly fish wanted with a liver.  ""That is the most important thing of all,"" said the stupid jelly fish, ""so as soon as I recollected it, I asked you if you had yours with you?""  ""Why is my liver so important to you?"" asked the monkey.  ""Oh! you will learn the reason later,"" said the jelly fish.",The jelly fish wonder if the monkey had brought his liver because knew very little of anatomy.

Then the jelly fish, seeing how anxious the monkey looked, was sorry for him, and told him everything. How the Dragon Queen had fallen ill, and how the doctor had said that only the liver of a live monkey would cure her, and how the Dragon King had sent him to find one.  ""Now I have done as I was told, and as soon as we arrive at the Palace the doctor will want your liver, so I feel sorry for you!"" said the silly jelly fish.  The poor monkey was horrified when he learnt all this, and very angry at the trick played upon him. He trembled with fear at the thought of what was in store for him.

14,528,"""The doctor means to cut me open and then take my liver out! Why I shall die!"" thought the monkey. At last a bright thought struck him, so he said quite cheerfully to the jelly fish:  ""What a pity it was, Mr. Jelly Fish, that you did not speak of this before we left the island!""  ""If I had told why I wanted you to accompany me you would certainly have refused to come,"" answered the jelly fish.  ""You are quite mistaken,"" said the monkey. ""Monkeys can very well spare a liver or two, especially when it is wanted for the Dragon Queen of the Sea. If I had only guessed of what you were in need. I should have presented you with one without waiting to be asked. I have several livers. But the greatest pity is, that as you did not speak in time, I have left all my livers hanging on the pine-tree.""  ""Have you left your liver behind you?"" asked the jelly fish.  ""Yes,"" said the cunning monkey, ""during the daytime I usually leave my liver hanging up on the branch of a tree, as it is very much in the way when I am climbing about from tree to tree. To-day, listening to your interesting conversation, I quite forgot it, and left it behind when I came off with you. If only you had spoken in time I should have remembered it, and should have brought it along with me!""",The jelly fish will take the monkey back because of what the monkey has said.
15,528,"The jelly fish was very disappointed when he heard this, for he believed every word the monkey said. The monkey was of no good without a liver.

I am really sorry to think of all your trouble; but if you will only take me back to the place where you found me, I shall soon be able to get my liver.""  The jelly fish did not at all like the idea of going all the way back to the island again; but the monkey assured him that if he would be so kind as to take him back he would get his very best liver, and bring it with him the next time. Thus persuaded, the jelly fish turned his course towards the Monkey Island once more.  No sooner had the jelly fish reached the shore than the sly monkey landed, and getting up into the pine-tree where the jelly fish had first seen him, he cut several capers amongst the branches with joy at being safe home again, and then looking down at the jelly fish said:  ""So many thanks for all the trouble you have taken! Please present my compliments to the Dragon King on your return!""",The jelly fish felt when he heard this by disappointed.

The monkey replied laughingly that he couldn't afford to lose his liver: it was too precious.  ""But remember your promise!"" pleaded the jelly fish, now very discouraged.  ""That promise was false, and anyhow it is now broken!"" answered the monkey. Then he began to jeer at the jelly fish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time; that he had no wish to lose his life, which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the Sea King's Palace to the old doctor waiting for him, instead of persuading the jelly fish to return under false pretenses.",His liver was too precious.
17,528,"""Of course, I won't GIVE you my liver, but come and get it if you can!"" added the monkey mockingly from the tree.  There was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and to return to the Dragon King of the Sea and to confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to swim back. The last thing he heard as he glided away, leaving the island behind him, was the monkey laughing at him.  Meanwhile the Dragon King, the doctor, the chief steward, and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jelly fish. When they caught sight of him approaching the Palace, they hailed him with delight. They began to thank him profusely for all the trouble he had taken in going to Monkey Island, and then they asked him where the monkey was.",The monkey treated the jelly fish once he escaped by mockingly.

""That promise was false, and anyhow it is now broken!"" answered the monkey. Then he began to jeer at the jelly fish and told him that he had been deceiving him the whole time; that he had no wish to lose his life, which he certainly would have done had he gone on to the Sea King's Palace to the old doctor waiting for him, instead of persuading the jelly fish to return under false pretenses.",The jelly fish felt discouraged because the monkey tricked him.
19,528,"""Of course, I won't GIVE you my liver, but come and get it if you can!"" added the monkey mockingly from the tree.  There was nothing for the jelly fish to do now but to repent of his stupidity, and to return to the Dragon King of the Sea and to confess his failure, so he started sadly and slowly to swim back. The last thing he heard as he glided away, leaving the island behind him, was the monkey laughing at him.  Meanwhile the Dragon King, the doctor, the chief steward, and all the servants were waiting impatiently for the return of the jelly fish. When they caught sight of him approaching the Palace, they hailed him with delight. They began to thank him profusely for all the trouble he had taken in going to Monkey Island, and then they asked him where the monkey was.",The jelly fish heard the monkey laughing at him as he left the island.

20,528,"The poor jelly fish, humiliated and horrified beyond all words, cried out for pardon. But the Dragon King's order had to be obeyed. The servants of the Palace forthwith each brought out a stick and surrounded the jelly fish, and after pulling out his bones they beat him to a flat pulp, and then took him out beyond the Palace gates and threw him into the water. Here he was left to suffer and repent his foolish chattering, and to grow accustomed to his new state of bonelessness.  From this story it is evident that in former times the jelly fish once had a shell and bones something like a tortoise, but, ever since the Dragon King's sentence was carried out on the ancestor of the jelly fishes, his descendants have all been soft and boneless just as you see them to-day thrown up by the waves high upon the shores of Japan.",The Dragon King's sentence change jelly fish descendants by jelly fish no longer had bones.
1,530,"There was once a rich peasant who had two sons, named John Nicholas and Lucky Andrew. The oldest was one of those fellows of whom one never can quite make head or tail. He was a most unpleasant customer to deal with, and he was more grasping and greedy than the folk of the Northland are, as a rule, though it is only too rare to find them unblessed with these attractive qualities. The other, Lucky Andrew, was wild and high spirited, but always good natured, and no matter how badly off he might be, he would always insist that he had been born under a lucky star. When the eagle, in order to defend his nest, belabored his head and face till the blood ran, he would still maintain that he was born under a lucky star, if only he managed to bring home a single eaglet. Did his boat capsize, which occasionally happened, and did they discover him hanging to it, quite overcome with the water, cold and exertion, and asked him how he felt, he would reply: ""O, quite well. I have been saved. I surely am in luck!""",John Nicholas was the older son.

7,530,"On Christmas Eve Andrew heard fiddles and music far out at sea; and when he came out, he saw a glow of light that came from a great Northland schooner, which was gliding toward the land--yet such a ship he had never yet seen. It has a main-sail of uncommon size, which looked to him to be of silk, and the most delicate tackling, as thin as though woven of steel wire, and everything else was in proportion, as fine and handsome as any Northlander might wish to have. The whole schooner was filled with little people dressed in blue, but the girl who stood at the helm was adorned like a bride, and looked as splendid as a queen, for she wore a crown and costly garments. Yet any one could see that she was a human being, for she was tall, and handsomer than the meer-folk. In fact, Lucky Andrew thought that she was handsomer than any girl he ever had seen. The schooner headed for the land where Andrew stood; but with his usual presence of mind, he hurried to the fisherman's hut, pulled down his gun from the wall, and crept up into the large loft and hid himself, so that he could see all that passed in the hut. He soon noticed that the whole room was alive with people.",Andrew heard on fiddles and music far out at sea Christmas Eve.

Terrified, he ran up into the hut, from whence he could see the trolls on the shore. They were short and thick like hay-ricks, completely covered with fur, with kirtles of skins, fishing boots, and enormous fist-gloves. In place of head and hair they had bundles of sea-weed.

There was placed before every one of them a magnificent cover with a case of massive gold, wherein were a spoon, knife, and fork, all of pure gold set with diamonds and rubies. But as they were all sitting down at table they saw come into the hall a very old fairy, whom they had not invited, because it was above fifty years since she had been out of a certain tower, and she was believed to be either dead or enchanted.  The King ordered her a cover, but could not furnish her with a case of gold as the others, because they had only seven made for the seven fairies. The old Fairy fancied she was slighted, and muttered some threats between her teeth.

3,536,"The old Fairy's turn coming next, with a head shaking more with spite than age, she said that the Princess should have her hand pierced with a spindle and die of the wound. This terrible gift made the whole company tremble, and everybody fell a-crying. At this very instant the young Fairy came out from behind the hangings, and spake these words aloud:  ""Assure yourselves, O King and Queen, that your daughter shall not die of this disaster. It is true, I have no power to undo entirely what my elder has done. The Princess shall indeed pierce her hand with a spindle; but, instead of dying, she shall only fall into a profound sleep, which shall last a hundred years, at the expiration of which a king's son shall come and awake her.""",The old fairy's gift made everyone feel by sad.
4,536,"The King, to avoid the misfortune foretold by the old Fairy, caused immediately proclamation to be made, whereby everybody was forbidden, on pain of death, to spin with a distaff and spindle, or to have so much as any spindle in their houses. About fifteen or sixteen years after, the King and Queen being gone to one of their houses of pleasure, the young Princess happened one day to divert herself in running up and down the palace; when going up from one apartment to another, she came into a little room on the top of the tower, where a good old woman, alone, was spinning with her spindle. This good woman had never heard of the King's proclamation against spindles.",The King forbade everyone from spinning with a distaff or spindle or had a spindle in their houses in order to avoid the misfortune told by the old fairy.

5,536,"""What are you doing there, goody?"" said the Princess.  ""I am spinning, my pretty child,"" said the old woman, who did not know who she was.  ""Ha!"" said the Princess, ""this is very pretty; how do you do it? Give it to me, that I may see if I can do so.""  She had no sooner taken it into her hand than, whether being very hasty at it, somewhat unhandy, or that the decree of the Fairy had so ordained it, it ran into her hand, and she fell down in a swoon.",As soon as the princess tried to spin the spindle she fell down in a swoon.
6,536,"One would have taken her for a little angel, she was so very beautiful; for her swooning away had not diminished one bit of her complexion; her cheeks were carnation, and her lips were coral; indeed, her eyes were shut, but she was heard to breathe softly, which satisfied those about her that she was not dead. The King commanded that they should not disturb her, but let her sleep quietly till her hour of awaking was come.  The good Fairy who had saved her life by condemning her to sleep a hundred years was in the kingdom of Matakin, twelve thousand leagues off, when this accident befell the Princess; but she was instantly informed of it by a little dwarf, who had boots of seven leagues, that is, boots with which he could tread over seven leagues of ground in one stride. The Fairy came away immediately, and she arrived, about an hour after, in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons.",The fairy arrived in a fiery chariot drawn by dragons.
7,536,"When a hundred years were gone and passed the son of the King then reigning, and who was of another family from that of the sleeping Princess, being gone a-hunting on that side of the country, asked:  What those towers were which he saw in the middle of a great thick wood?  Everyone answered according as they had heard. Some said:  That it was a ruinous old castle, haunted by spirits.",Was the son of the King on that side of the country because he had gone a - hunting.
8,536,"They went into the great hall of looking-glasses, where they supped, and were served by the Princess's officers, the violins and hautboys played old tunes, but very excellent, though it was now above a hundred years since they had played; and after supper, without losing any time, the lord almoner married them in the chapel of the castle, and the chief lady of honor drew the curtains. They had but very little sleep-the Princess had no occasion; and the Prince left her next morning to return to the city, where his father must needs have been in pain for him. The Prince told him:  That he lost his way in the forest as he was hunting, and that he had lain in the cottage of a charcoal-burner, who gave him cheese and brown bread.  The King, his father, who was a good man, believed him; but his mother could not be persuaded it was true; and seeing that he went almost every day a-hunting, and that he always had some excuse ready for so doing, though he had lain out three or four nights together, she began to suspect that he was married, for he lived with the Princess above two whole years, and had by her two children, the eldest of which, who was a daughter, was named Morning, and the youngest, who was a son, they called Day, because he was a great deal handsomer and more beautiful than his sister.",Morning and Day were the names of the Prince's and Princess's children
9,536,"The Queen spoke several times to her son, to inform herself after what manner he did pass his time, and that in this he ought in duty to satisfy her. But he never dared to trust her with his secret; he feared her, though he loved her, for she was of the race of the Ogres, and the King would never have married her had it not been for her vast riches; it was even whispered about the Court that she had Ogreish inclinations, and that, whenever she saw little children passing by, she had all the difficulty in the world to avoid falling upon them. And so the Prince would never tell her one word.  But when the King was dead, which happened about two years afterward, and he saw himself lord and master, he openly declared his marriage; and he went in great ceremony to conduct his Queen to the palace. They made a magnificent entry into the capital city, she riding between her two children.",The Prince did not tell his mother the truth because she was of the race of the Ogres.

Nobody knew where Snorro came from, or how long he had dwelt in the dark chamber inside the Dwarfie Stone. All that they knew about him was that he was a little man, with a queer, twisted, deformed body and a face of marvellous beauty, which never seemed to look any older, but was always smiling and young.  Men said that this was because Snorro's father had been a Fairy, and not a denizen of earth, who had bequeathed to his son the gift of perpetual youth, but nobody knew whether this were true or not, for the Dwarf had inhabited the Dwarfie Stone long before the oldest man or woman in Hoy had been born.  One thing was certain, however: he had inherited from his mother, whom all men agreed had been mortal, the dangerous qualities of vanity and ambition.

'They are here, master,' said the birds, and so they were, and never had the young man seen anything so splendid.","Ian called for the three little birds after he met the weaver because he wanted a horse, dress, and shoes."
17,540,"Mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses were assembling for the great race, and took his place among them. Many good beasts were there which had won many races, but the horse of the fisher's son left them all behind, and he was first at the winning post. The king's daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize, for he went back to the wood, and got off his horse, and put on his old clothes, and bade the box place some gold in his pockets. After that he went back to the weaver's house, and told him that the gold had been given him by the man who had won the race, and that the weaver might have it for his kindness to him.  Now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess, the king ordered another race to be run, and the fisher's son rode into the field still more splendidly dressed than he was before, and easily distanced everybody else. But again he left the prize unclaimed, and so it happened on the third day, when it seemed as if all the people in the kingdom were gathered to see the race, for they were filled with curiosity to know who the winner could be.",After Ian won the horse - race again he left the prize unclaimed.
18,540,"If he will not come of his own free will, he must be brought,' said the king, and the messengers who had seen the face of the victor were sent to seek him in every street of the town. This took many days, and when at last they found the young man in the weaver's cottage, he was so dirty and ugly and had such a strange appearance, that they declared he could not be the winner they had been searching for, but a wicked robber who had murdered ever so many people, but had always managed to escape.  'Yes, it must be the robber,' said the king, when the fisher's son was led into his presence; 'build a gallows at once and hang him in the sight of all my subjects, that they may behold him suffer the punishment of his crimes.'",The messengers believed Ian was not the winner because he was dirty and ugly and had such a strange appearance.
19,540,"So the gallows was built upon a high platform, and the fisher's son mounted the steps up to it, and turned at the top to make the speech that was expected from every doomed man, innocent or guilt. As he spoke he happened to raise his arm, and the king's daughter, who was there at her father's side, saw the name which she had written under it. With a shriek she sprang from her seat, and the eyes of the spectators were turned towards her.  'Stop! stop!' she cried, hardly knowing what she said. 'If that man is hanged there is not a soul in the kingdom but shall die also.' And running up to where the fisher's son was standing, she took him by the hand, saying,  'Father, this is no robber or murderer, but the victor in the three races, and he loosed the spells that were laid upon me.'",The princess recognized Ian by the king's daughter saw the name which she had written under it.

20,540,"Then, without waiting for a reply, she conducted him into the palace, and he bathed in a marble bath, and all the dirt that the fairies had put upon him disappeared like magic, and when he had dressed himself in the fine garments the princess had sent to him, he looked a match for any king's daughter in Erin. He went down into the great hall where she was awaiting him, and they had much to tell each other but little time to tell it in, for the king her father, and the princes who were visiting him, and all the people of the kingdom were still in their places expecting her return.  'How did you find me out?' she whispered as they went down the passage.",The princess conducted him into the palace after she saved him from getting killed.
21,540,"The birds in the box told me,' answered he, but he could say no more, as they stepped out into the open space that was crowded with people. There the princes stopped.  'O kings!' she said, turning towards them, 'if one of you were killed to-day, the rest would fly; but this man put his trust in me, and had his head cut off three times. Because he has done this, I will marry him rather than one of you, who have come hither to wed me, for many kings here sought to free me from the spells, but none could do it save Ian the fisher's son.'",The princess decided to marry Ian.

He had dressed himself in cool white clothes, and was passing through the hall on his way to the council chamber, when a number of young nobles suddenly appeared before him, and one amongst them stepped forward and spoke.

The prince lost his temper, and said many insulting things to the other, who was playing against him, till at length the gentleman whom you see there struck him violently in the face, so that the blood ran from his mouth and nose.

9,542,"At last the ceremony was over, and the king, signing to his newly found son to follow him, rose and went into another room.  'Tell me how you knew all that,' he said, throwing himself into a carved chair filled with crimson cushions, and the prince told of his meeting with the old woman who had brought him the jewels from his mother, and how he had sworn before a priest to marry her, though he did not want to do it, on account of the difference in their ages, and besides, he would rather receive a bride chosen by the king himself. But the king frowned, and answered sharply:  'You swore to marry her if she saved your life, and, come what may, you must fulfil your promise.'

Why suddenly grow so angry about it?""",The farmer called the bonze names when he grew angry.

An artisan saw the whole affair from his shop, and since the noise annoyed him, he took some money, bought a pear and gave it to the bonze.  The bonze thanked him and said: ""One like myself, who has given up the world, must not be miserly. I have beautiful pears myself, and I invite you all to eat them with me."" Then some one asked: ""If you have pears then why do you not eat your own?"" He answered: ""I first must have a seed to plant.""",The bystanders told the farmer to give the bonze one of the smaller pears and let him go.

3,546,"And with that he began to eat the pear with gusto. When he had finished, he held the pit in his hand, took his pick-ax from his shoulder; and dug a hole a couple of inches deep. Into this he thrust the pit, and covered it with earth. Then he asked the folk in the market place for water, with which to water it. A pair of curiosity seekers brought him hot water from the hostelry in the street, and with it the bonze watered the pit. Thousands of eyes were turned on the spot. And the pit could already be seen to sprout. The sprout grew and in a moment it had turned into a tree. Branches and leaves burgeoned out from it. It began to blossom and soon the fruit had ripened: large, fragrant pears, which hung in thick clusters from the boughs. The bonze climbed into the tree and handed down the pears to the bystanders. In a moment all the pears had been eaten up. Then the bonze took his pick-ax and cut down the tree. Crash, crash! so it went for a while, and the tree was felled. Then he took the tree on his shoulder and walked away at an easy gait.",The bonze cut down the tree because all the pears had been eaten up.

His pears had all disappeared. Then he realized that the pears the bonze had divided had been his own. He looked more closely, and the axle of his cart had disappeared. It was plainly evident that it had been chopped off quite recently. The farmer fell into a rage and hastened after the bonze as fast as ever he could. And when he turned the corner, there lay the missing piece from the axle by the city wall. And then he realized that the pear-tree which the bonze had chopped down must have been his axle.

1,548,"There was once a fisherman who was called Salmon, and his Christian name was Matte. He lived by the shore of the big sea; where else could he live? He had a wife called Maie; could you find a better name for her? In winter they dwelt in a little cottage by the shore, but in spring they flitted to a red rock out in the sea and stayed there the whole summer until it was autumn. The cottage on the rock was even smaller than the other; it had a wooden bolt instead of an iron lock to the door, a stone hearth, a flagstaff, and a weather-cock on the roof.  The rock was called Ahtola, and was not larger than the market-place of a town. Between the crevices there grew a little rowan tree and four alder bushes. Heaven only knows how they ever came there; perhaps they were brought by the winter storms. Besides that, there flourished some tufts of velvety grass, some scattered reeds, two plants of the yellow herb called tansy, four of a red flower, and a pretty white one; but the treasures of the rock consisted of three roots of garlic, which Maie had put in a cleft. Rock walls sheltered them on the north side, and the sun shone on them on the south.

'We have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass,' rejoined Maie.  'Yes, of course,' laughed Matte, 'and we have also three plants of garlic. Garlic would be fine feeding for her.'  'Every cow likes salt herring,' rejoined his wife. 'Even Prince is fond of fish.'  'That may be,' said her husband. 'Methinks she would soon be a dear cow if we had to feed her on salt herring. All very well for Prince, who fights with the gulls over the last morsel. Put the cow out of your head, mother, we are very well off as we are.'",Maie felt after her husband did not let her buy a cow by sad.
4,548,"Maie sighed. She knew well that her husband was right, but she could not give up the idea of a cow. The buttermilk no longer tasted as good as usual in the coffee; she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter, and of how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them.  One day as Matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they heard Prince barking, and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with three young men in it, steering towards the rock. They were students, on a boating excursion, and wanted to get something to eat.  'Bring us a junket, good mother,' cried they to Maie.  'Ah! if only I had such a thing!' sighed Maie.  'A can of fresh milk, then,' said the students; 'but it must not be skim.'  'Yes, if only I had it!' sighed the old woman, still more deeply.  'What! haven't you got a cow?'",Three young men appeared on a gaily painted boat.

'What! haven't you got a cow?'",The three young men asked for a junket.
5,548,"Maie was silent. This question so struck her to the heart that she could not reply.  'We have no cow,' Matte answered; 'but we have good smoked herring, and can cook them in a couple of hours.'  'All right, then, that will do,' said the students, as they flung themselves down on the rock, while fifty silvery-white herring were turning on the spit in front of the fire.  'What's the name of this little stone in the middle of the ocean?' asked one of them.  'Ahtola,' answered the old man.  'Well, you should want for nothing when you live in the Sea King's dominion.'",Maie cooked for good smoked herring the young men.
6,548,"Matte did not understand. He had never read Kalevala and knew nothing of the sea gods of old, but the students proceeded to explain to him.[FN#2: Kalevala is a collection of old Finnish songs about gods and heroes.]  'Ahti,' said they, 'is a mighty king who lives in his dominion of Ahtola, and has a rock at the bottom of the sea, and possesses besides a treasury of good things. He rules over all fish and animals of the deep; he has the finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grass at the bottom of the ocean. He who stands well with Ahti is soon a rich man, but one must beware in dealing with him, for he is very changeful and touchy. Even a little stone thrown into the water might offend him, and then as he takes back his gift, he stirs up the sea into a storm and drags the sailors down into the depths. Ahti owns also the fairest maidens, who bear the train of his queen Wellamos, and at the sound of music they comb their long, flowing locks, which glisten in the water.'  'Oh!' cried Matte, 'have your worships really seen all that?'  'We have as good as seen it,' said the students. 'It is all printed in a book, and everything printed is true.'  'I'm not so sure of that,' said Matte, as he shook his head.","Ahti lived in his dominion of Ahtola, and had a rock at the bottom of the sea, and possessed besides a treasury of good things."

'But there are streaks in the north-western sky, and Prince was eating grass this evening,' said the old man.  'Surely he has not eaten my garlic,' exclaimed the old woman.  'No; but there will be rough weather by to-morrow at sunset,' rejoined Matte.

10,548,"The old man allowed himself to be talked over, and so they rowed out with the net.

King of the waters, far and near,                I ask not of thy golden store,           I wish not jewels of pearl to wear,                Nor silver either, ask I for,           But one is odd and even is two,                So give me a cow, sea-king so bold,           And in return I'll give to you                A slice of the moon, and the sun's gold.

11,548,"Oh, only the words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,' answered the old woman; and she raised her voice and went on:            Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,                Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,           A thousand cows are in thy herd,                I pray thee give one onto me.

His wife pretended not to hear him, and sang and sang the same tune all the time they were on the water. Matte heard nothing more as he sat and rowed the heavy boat, while thinking of his cracked pipe and the fine tobacco. Then they returned to the island, and soon after went to bed.  But neither Matte nor Maie could sleep a wink; the one thought of how he had profaned Sunday, and the other of Ahti's cow.",Matte believed Maie sang a stupid song because she asked for cows.

13,548,"Both rose. The summer night was as dark as if it had been October, the weather-cock creaked, and the storm was raging in every direction. As they went out the sea lay around them as white as now, and the spray was dashing right over the fisher-hut. In all his life Matte had never remembered such a night. To launch the boat and put to sea to rescue the net was a thing not to be thought of. The fisherman and his wife stood aghast on the doorstep, holding on fast by the doorpost, while the foam splashed over their faces.  'Did I not tell thee that there is no luck in Sunday fishing?' said Matte sulkily; and his wife was so frightened that she never even once thought of Ahti's cows.  As there was nothing to be done, they went in. Their eyes were heavy for lack of slumber, and they slept as soundly as if there had not been such a thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling. When they awoke, the sun was high in the heavens, the tempest had cased, and only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the red rock.",N't Matte wanted to get the herring - net because the storm was strong.
14,548,"What can that be?' said the old woman, as she peeped out of the door.  'It looks like a big seal,' said Matte.  'As sure as I live, it's a cow!' exclaimed Maie. And certainly it was a cow, a fine red cow, fat and flourishing, and looking as if it had been fed all its days on spinach. It wandered peacefully up and down the shore, and never so much as even looked at the poor little tufts of grass, as if it despised such fare.  Matte could not believe his eyes. But a cow she seemed, and a cow she was found to be; and when the old woman began to milk her, every pitcher and pan, even to the baler, was soon filled with the most delicious milk.  The old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there, and sallied forth to seek for his lost net. He had not proceeded far when he found it cast up on the shore, and so full of fish that not a mesh was visible.",Maie felt after she saw the cow by excited.

15,548,"It is all very fine to possess a cow,' said Matte, as he cleaned the fish; 'but what are we going to feed her on?'  'We shall find some means,' said his wife; and the cow found the means herself. She went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great abundance near the shore, and always kept in good condition. Every one Prince alone excepted, thought she was a clever beast; but Prince barked at her, for he had now got a rival.  From that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets, and every net was filled with fish. Matte and Maie grew fat on this fine living, and daily became richer. She churned quantities of butter, and he hired two men to help him in his fishing. The sea lay before him like a big fish tank, out of which he hauled as many as he required; and the cow continued to fend for herself. In autumn, when Matte and Maie went ashore, the cow went to sea, and in spring, when they returned to the rock, there she stood awaiting them.",The cow went to sea in the autumn.
16,548,"We shall require a better house,' said Maie the following summer; 'the old one is too small for ourselves and the men.'  'Yes,' said Matte. So he built a large cottage, with a real lock to the door, and a store-house for fish as well; and he and his men caught such quantities of fish that they sent tons of salmon, herring, and cod to Russian and Sweden.  'I am quite overworked with so many folk,' said Maie; 'a girl to help me would not come amiss.'  'Get one, then,' said her husband; and so they hired a girl.  Then Maie said: 'We have too little milk for all these folk. Now that I have a servant, with the same amount of trouble she could look after three cows.'  'All right, then,' said her husband, somewhat provoked, 'you can sing a song to the fairies.'",Maie wanted a better house because the old one was too small for themselves and the men.

Then Maie said: 'We have too little milk for all these folk. Now that I have a servant, with the same amount of trouble she could look after three cows.'  'All right, then,' said her husband, somewhat provoked, 'you can sing a song to the fairies.'","Matte built a large cottage, with a real lock to the door, and a store - house."
16,548,"We shall require a better house,' said Maie the following summer; 'the old one is too small for ourselves and the men.'  'Yes,' said Matte.

17,548,"This annoyed Maie, but nevertheless she rowed out to sea on Sunday night and sang as before:            Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,                Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,           A thousand cows are in thy herd,                I pray thee give three unto me.  The following morning, instead of one, three cows stood on the island, and they all ate seaweed and fended for themselves like the first one.",After Maie hummed the magic rhyme on Sunday night three cows stood on the island.
18,548,"Art thou satisfied now?' said Matte to his wife.  'I should be quite satisfied,' said his wife, 'if only I had two servants to help, and if I had some finer clothes. Don't you know that I am addressed as Madam?'  'Well, well,' said her husband. So Maie got several servants and clothes fit for a great lady.  'Everything would now be perfect if only we had a little better dwelling for summer. You might build us a two-storey house, and fetch soil to make a garden. Then you might make a little arbour up there to let us have a sea-view; and we might have a fiddler to fiddle to us of an evening, and a little steamer to take us to church in stormy weather.'  'Anything more?' asked Matte; but he did everything that his wife wished. The rock Ahtola became so grand and Maie so grand that all the sea-urchins and herring were lost in wonderment. Even Prince was fed on beefsteaks and cream scones till at last he was as round as a butter jar.  'Are you satisfied now?' asked Matte.  'I should be quite satisfied,' said Maie, 'if only I had thirty cows. At least that number is required for such a household.'  'Go to the fairies,' said Matte.",Maie wanted a two - storey house Matte to build.

19,548,"His wife set out in the new steamer and sang to the sea-king. Next morning thirty cows stood on the shore, all finding food for themselves.  'Know'st thou, good man, that we are far too cramped on this wretched rock, and where am I to find room for so many cows?'  'There is nothing to be done but to pump out the sea.'  'Rubbish!' said his wife. 'Who can pump out the sea?'  'Try with thy new steamer, there is a pump in it.'  Maie knew well that her husband was only making fun of her, but still her mind was set upon the same subject. 'I never could pump the sea out,' thought she, 'but perhaps I might fill it up, if I were to make a big dam. I might heap up sand and stones, and make our island as big again.'",Matte will suggest to make pump out the sea more space for their cows.

20,548,"Maie loaded her boat with stones and went out to sea. The fiddler was with her, and fiddled so finely that Ahti and Wellamos and all the sea's daughters rose to the surface of the water to listen to the music.  'What is that shining so brightly in the waves?' asked Maie.  'That is sea foam glinting in the sunshine,' answered the fiddler.  'Throw out the stones,' said Maie.  The people in the boat began to throw out the stones, splash, splash, right and left, into the foam. One stone hit the nose of Wellamos's chief lady-in-waiting, another scratched the sea queen herself on the cheek, a third plumped close to Ahti's head and tore off half of the sea-king's beard; then there was a commotion in the sea, the waves bubbled and bubbled like boiling water in a pot",Ahti felt after he was hit by stones by furious.
21,548,"Whence comes this gust of wind?' said Maie; and as she spoke the sea opened and swallowed up the steamer. Maie sank to the bottom like a stone, but, stretching out her arms and legs, she rose to the surface, where she found the fiddler's fiddle, and used it as a float. At the same moment she saw close beside her the terrible head of Ahti, and he had only half a beard!'  'Why did you throw stones at me?' roared the sea-king.  'Oh, your majesty, it was a mistake! Put some bear's grease on your beard and that will soon make it grow again.'  'Dame, did I not give you all you asked for--nay, even more?'  'Truly, truly, your majesty. Many thanks for the cows.'  'Well, where is the gold from the sun and the silver from the moon that you promised me?'  'Ah, your majesty, they have been scattered day and night upon the sea, except when the sky was overcast,' slyly answered Maie.  'I'll teach you!' roared the sea-king; and with that he gave the fiddle such a 'puff' that it sent the old woman up like a sky-rocket on to her island. There Prince lay, as famished as ever, gnawing the carcase of a crow. There sat Matte in his ragged grey jacket, quite alone, on the steps of the old hut, mending a net.",After Ahti sent Maie like a sky - rocket on to her island she woke up from her dream.
22,548,"Heavens, mother,' said he, 'where are you coming from at such a whirlwind pace, and what makes you in such a dripping condition?'  Maie looked around her amazed, and said, 'Where is our two-storey house?'  'What house?' asked her husband.  'Our big house, and the flower garden, and the men and the maids, and the thirty beautiful cows, and the steamer, and everything else?'  'You are talking nonsense, mother,' said he. 'The students have quite turned your head, for you sang silly songs last evening while we were rowing, and then you could not sleep till early morning. We had stormy weather during the night, and when it was past I did not wish to waken you, so rowed out alone to rescue the net.'  'But I've seen Ahti,' rejoined Maie.  'You've been lying in bed, dreaming foolish fancies, mother, and then in your sleep you walked into the water.'  'But there is the fiddle,' said Maie.  'A fine fiddle! It is only an old stick. No, no, old woman, another time we will be more careful. Good luck never attends fishing on a Sunday.'",Maie felt after she woke up from her dream by confused.
